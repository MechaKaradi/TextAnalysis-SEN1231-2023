# TextAnalysis-SEN1231-2023
Code used to generate the text analysis for the course SEN 1231

The python files in the folder `Web Scrapping` were used to download data from the MPA-Singapore's Magazine Nautilus, and from the ProQuest Search results page.

The R files were each used to analyse the text results from the data sets.
