Singapore Freight Transport Report - Q2 2015,"Our forecasts for freight transport volumes through the major Singapore facilities of Changi International Airport and the port of Singapore are positive, reflecting a broadly positive domestic and global macroeconomic environment. Singapore's role as a global transhipment hub is both a blessing and a curse, with volumes prone to declining in times of global recession, but at present we expect that the country will benefit from relatively solid demand from key markets in Europe, where falling oil prices will support consumer demand growth. That said, the growth will be fairly lacklustre, especially in terms of air freight, and there remain salient downside risks, not least a slowing Chinese economy.",1658809286,,Reports,,,, Copyright 2015 Business Monitor International.

Coping with the surge: what mega-vessels and mega-volumes mean for maritime terminal operators,"London - A combination of dramatic vessel upsizing and new alliance strategies is being hailed as the way for the global container shipping industry to return to sustainable profitability by making deep cuts to operating costs. But while this might be good news for carriers, does the same hold true for the container terminal sector* The concentration of large container volumes into a single weekly call will put a significant strain on the capacity of a maritime terminal to work the ship, both on the quay and landside. For terminals handling origin and destination cargo, the container surge will also take a big toll on gate operations. Truck drivers delivering and picking up containers might well have to contend with increased gate congestion and turn times stretching to hours. TOC CSC Asia is held in conjunction with the Singapore Maritime Week 2014 (SMW). Organised by the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore, SMW is Singapores iconic maritime show and is testament to the republics growing role as a host for major maritime events and development as a leading international maritime centre. Singapore Maritime Week (SMW) is the leading maritime event in Singapore. Driven by the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA), SMW gathers the international maritime community in Singapore for a week of conferences, dialogues, exhibitions and social events in celebration of all things maritime. The range of activities and events organised by MPA, the industry, and research and educational institutions, as well as the cosmopolitan profile of participants, reflect the vibrancy and diversity of Singapore as a major international maritime centre. The dynamism and the good range of issues discussed during SMW are major draws for maritime decision-makers, as are the many business networking platforms. This is why Singapore Maritime Week is all about PEOPLE, IDEAS and OPPORTUNITIES for the maritime community.",1508441773,,Wire Feeds,,,," (Copyright M2 Communications, 2014)", News," Mar 19, 2014",,, English,,, Coventry,"Mar 19, 2014",M2 Presswire,2014,,https://www.proquest.com/wire-feeds/coping-with-surge-what-mega-vessels-volumes-mean/docview/1508441773/se-2?accountid=27026," 48411 General Freight Trucking, Local , 48831 Port and Harbor Operations"," 48411 General Freight Trucking, Local , 48831 Port and Harbor Operations",,," 48411 General Freight Trucking, Local , 48831 Port and Harbor Operations",, n/a," 48411 General Freight Trucking, Local , 48831 Port and Harbor Operations"," Supply chains , Chief executive officers , Logistics , Shipping industry , Productivity , Alliances , Ports",,"http://sfx.tudelft.nl:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apq1busgeneral&amp;atitle=Coping+with+the+surge%3A+what+mega-vessels+and+mega-volumes+mean+for+maritime+terminal+operators&amp;title=M2+Presswire&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-03-19&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=M2+Presswire&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/, http://tudelft.on.worldcat.org/atoztitles/link?sid=ProQ:&amp;issn=&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;title=M2+Presswire&amp;spage=&amp;date=2014-03-19&amp;atitle=Coping+with+the+surge%3A+what+mega-vessels+and+mega-volumes+mean+for+maritime+terminal+operators&amp;au=&amp;id=doi:",ProQuest One Business

Europe's Green Groups Fear Loopholes in IMO Ship-Efficiency Deal,"""Last November, nine states led by Norway defied a procedural deadlock and asked for the proposed EEDI to be circulated among IMO members for decision as a mandatory global measure. After intense negotiations, the measure was adopted at the IMO's Marine Environment Protection Committee in London [this month] but Saudi Arabia immediately challenged the decision, forcing a vote which was convincingly carried 48 votes in favor to five against (China, Chile, Brazil, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia) with two abstentions. ""Adoption of the EEDI means that ships built after 2013 will have to meet a minimum standard of energy efficiency, with different standards applying to different classes of ship. These standards will be strengthened over time, with the aim of a 10% improvement for ships built in 2015 to 2019, 20% for 2020 to 2024, and 30% for ships delivered after 2024. But as the average life of a ship is around 30 years, it will take a decade or two before the effects of the EEDI start to become widespread. ""European Union [EU] countries and USA/Australia/ Japan wanted to retain the provision in Singapore's draft resolution reiterating the right under international law for port states to deny entry to non-EEDI-compliant ships. This right of denial of port entry had been a central element in the resolution of the double-hulled issue a decade earlier as it enabled the EU to support the IMO phase-out of single-hulled ships while at the same time preserving the right of EU states to prevent non-compliant (single-hulled) ships from entering EU ports.",1525848762,,Trade Journals,,Anonymous,," Copyright Hart Energy Jul 25, 2011", News," Jul 25, 2011",1092-2849,29, English,, 15-16, Houston,"Jul 25, 2011",Diesel Fuel News,2011,15,https://www.proquest.com/trade-journals/europes-green-groups-fear-loopholes-imo-ship/docview/1525848762/se-2?accountid=27026, 48831 Port and Harbor Operations, 48831 Port and Harbor Operations,,, 48831 Port and Harbor Operations,, 15, 48831 Port and Harbor Operations," Ships , Environmental protection , Climate change , International law , Energy efficiency , Marine pollution , Loopholes , Technology transfer , Developing countries--LDCs , Industrialized nations , Waivers , Ports , Brazil , China , India , Saudi Arabia",,"http://sfx.tudelft.nl:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apq1busgeneral&amp;atitle=Europe%27s+Green+Groups+Fear+Loopholes+in+IMO+Ship-Efficiency+Deal&amp;title=Diesel+Fuel+News&amp;issn=10922849&amp;date=2011-07-25&amp;volume=15&amp;issue=29&amp;spage=15&amp;au=Anonymous&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Diesel+Fuel+News&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/, http://tudelft.on.worldcat.org/atoztitles/link?sid=ProQ:&amp;issn=10922849&amp;volume=15&amp;issue=29&amp;title=Diesel+Fuel+News&amp;spage=15&amp;date=2011-07-25&amp;atitle=Europe%27s+Green+Groups+Fear+Loopholes+in+IMO+Ship-Efficiency+Deal&amp;au=Anonymous&amp;id=doi:",ProQuest One Business

Singapore Shipping Report - Q3 2010,"Net profit at Singapore-based Neptune Orient Lines (NOL) stood at US$282mn in Q310, compared with a loss of US$139mn in the year-ago period, it was reported in October. The company also recorded a 55% year-on-year (y-o-y) surge in revenues to US$2.43bn in the same period. This was due to a recovery in global shipping demand. The company's net earnings reached US$283mn through the first three quarters of 2010, compared with a loss of US$530mn during the same period of 2009. NOL expects to register a profit for 2010. NOL's core businesses include container transportation and supply chain management, assisted by a fleet of 59 container ships ranging in capacity from 1,858 to 5,570 20-foot equivalent units (TEUs) and 20 feeder vessels with capacities of between 253 and 1,538TEUs Going into 2011 Singapore's economic fundamentals remain strong, with both domestic demand and exports looking healthy; the economy has proved itself to be resilient and continues to attract foreign investment. Following the vigorous recovery during 2010, there are signs of a technical pause in growth emerging because of strong base effects. BMI remains optimistic about the Singaporean economy, not least because of the combination of its business-friendly policies and its location in Asia, which has to a considerable extent sidestepped the sluggishness of the US and Europe. Bearing in mind these factors, BMI is predicting a growth slowdown in Singapore, with GDP dropping from the exceptional 12.8% expansion of 2010 down to a forecast 3.3% in 2011. In 2012 we see the pace picking up again with 4.5% growth in the economy. During the global recession in 2009 Port of Singapore (POS) tonnage fell by a sharp 8.4% to 472.3mn tonnes; now, in view if the strength of Singapore's recovery, we see all of that ground being made up. BMI estimates POS tonnage rose by 6.9% in 2010, and we are projecting a further 4.2% expansion in 2011 to reach 526.34mn tonnes, above the pre-2009 peak of 515.42mn tonnes. Box traffic at POS has followed the bulk tonnage volume trend, but with lower troughs and higher peaks. So container handling dropped more sharply in 2009 (by 13.5%) and recovered more vigorously in 2010 (+12.3%). For 2011 BMI is forecasting growth of 5.0% to 30.513mn TEUs, bringing the total above the pre-2009 peak. In real terms Singapore's total trade is set to expand by 5.7% in 2011, after a 10% contraction in 2009 and a 15.1% recovery in 2010. Looking forward, we expect Singapore to settle down to rather more moderate trade growth. Average annual trade growth in the next five years will be 5.1%, a little ahead of GDP. This year, export growth will be marginally behind imports, but over the five-year time span we expect both to be roughly on a par. In nominal terms, exports will increase by 8.6% this year to US$492.12bn, while imports will grow fractionally faster, gaining 9.1% to US$437.1bn. We believe there is a downside risk to our port and shipping forecasts if Chinese growth in 2011 comes in below expectations, therefore cooling activity levels across Asia. Singapore remains a very outward looking economy and it is therefore dependent on the general regional and global economic climate.",872459961,,Reports,,,, Copyright 2011 Business Monitor International.
